<h1>Description</h1>
<p>his veggie omelet is delicious served on top of toast.
  Use any cheese you like â€” Swiss and Gouda are both good choices.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 Tablespoons of butter,divided</li>
  <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
  <li>1 green bell pepper,chopped</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon salt,divided</li>
  <li>4 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of milk</li>
  <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.
    Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
    Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside. </li>
  <li>Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. </li>
  <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom
    of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until
    the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to
    let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to
    look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes. </li>
  <li>Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold
    omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate.
    Cut in half and serve.</li>
